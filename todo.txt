-we changed prepare_child to loop through each seed mol 40 times, so we could have many children for
each seed

-figure out optimal max mol. length (already changed to 81)
	-find what the average/max molecule length is for their SMILES results.
	-a molecule can be operated on multiple times if selected in seed more than once

-organize into seperate files (mutation functions)
-add crossover mutations

-save results to csv/excel

-read Dr. Hu's and Eric's paper
-Start intro
