Journal:

	-we changed prepare_child to loop through each seed mol 40 times, so we could have many children for
	each seed

	-changed mol. max length to 81, then changed to 140
		-find what the average/max molecule length is for their SMILES results.
		-a molecule can be operated on multiple times if selected in seed more than once in original

To do:
	-organize into seperate files (mutation functions)
	
	-add crossover mutations
	-add remove mutations
	
	-save results to csv/excel

	-read Dr. Hu's and Eric's paper
	-Start intro
