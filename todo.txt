Logbook (Diary):

	-got crossover working (maybe)
	
	-removed try block from sanitize smiles, and mutate functions. We will get error now if sanitise_smiles doesn't work
	
	-we changed prepare_child to loop through each seed mol 40 times, so we could have many children for
	each seed

	-changed mol. max length to 81, then changed to 140
		-find what the average/max molecule length is for their SMILES results.
		-a molecule can be operated on multiple times if selected in seed more than once in original

To do:
	-make another crossover function with left and right swapped
	
	-try crossover with two seeds rather than seed and bank
	
	-in prepare child check mol_length
	
	-figure out mol. length of molfinder original (long molecules aren't good, they might be generating long molecules)
	
	-organize into seperate files (mutation functions)
	
	-add crossover mutations
	-add remove mutations
	-original does only one mutation per new child, we do up to 2. Change this?
	
	-save results to csv/excel

	-read Dr. Hu's and Eric's paper
	-Start intro
